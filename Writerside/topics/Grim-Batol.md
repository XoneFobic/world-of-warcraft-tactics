# Grim Batol

Route: [Keystone.guru - Bunten](https://keystone.guru/route/grim-batol/2G3oBAs/raiderio-weekly-route-bunten/1)

## Between start and General Umbriss

- Kill everything, except for the third (last) Twilight Destroyer before the boss.
- Tank the first Twilight Destroyer into the wall to the right of the stairs around the corner, so that the rest of the party can line of sight the knock back.

## General Umbriss

- Drop **Rock spikes** to the outsides. The wall behind the boss or the 'wall' where we came from.

## Between General Umbriss and Forgemaster Throngus

- If you need more time before pulling the boss after he starts moving. Stay behind the anvils. The boss will walk passed.
- Wait with pulling the Molten Giant groups until 2 seconds after one of the Twilight Beguilers gets knocked back. It will stun the Molten Giant for 14 seconds once the Beguiler comes back to the group.

## Forgemaster Throngus

- Make sure to bait the **Fiery Cleave** into a wall.
- Tank doesn't get targeted by **Fiery Cleave** unless there's less than 5 players alive.

## Between Forgemaster Throngus and Dragha Shadowburner

- When going down the initial stairs, **do not** pull any of the mobs to the right.
- Line of sight the Twilight Lavabender back up the stairs.
- Line of sight the Twilight Enforcer and Twilight Flamerender back up the stairs.
- Before going over the broken bridge, **do not** pull the 2 Twilight Warlock to the right.
- Directly after the broken bridge, **do not** pull the Twilight Destroyer to the left.
- Mark one of the Twilight Lavabenders as primary target.

## Dragha Shadowburner

- Don't use DPS cooldowns in the first phase. Safe them for the dragon phase.
- Tank move to the 'cubbyhole' to the right of the arena, stand all the way in the back of it.
- Melee, keep at max range to make sure the **Twilight Wind** won't hit the tank.

## Between Dragha Shadowburner and Erudax

- Be at **> 81.3%** before proceeding, else you won't make the kill target.
- Last trash group before the boss, mark one of the Faceless Corruptors as primary target.

## Erudax

- Slow down on AoE directly after the adds spawn and stack on the healer. Tank will get a knock back and aggro them directly after.
- When the circle appears, look to the edges of the room. If you can see the circle, move in that direction comparatively of the room.
  - Ping the ground with a general location of circle center.
